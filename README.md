# Can I have a logo?

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes user input to generate a logo and saves it as a SVG file. The user answers a series of prompts to select a shape, pick a color for the shape, provide up to 3 letters to display on the shape, and pick a color for the text.
